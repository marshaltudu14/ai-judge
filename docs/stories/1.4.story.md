# Story: 1.4 - Header

## Story

As a user, I want to clearly see the kanoon.ai brand, so that I know which application I am using.
As a user, I want to easily switch between light and dark visual themes, so that I can customize my viewing experience.
As a user, I want to see my user avatar or name, so that I feel a sense of personalization and account presence.

## Acceptance Criteria

*   The Header displays the "kanoon.ai" logo/name prominently.
*   A theme toggle button/switch is present in the Header to switch between light and dark modes.
*   The Header displays a small conceptual user avatar or name.
*   The Header adheres to the defined visual design guidelines (branding, color, typography, iconography, spacing, animations).
*   The Header incorporates accessibility considerations (semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, color contrast, etc.).

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No specific insights from previous stories that directly impact the implementation of the Header, other than general adherence to established architectural and UI guidelines.

### Data Models
No specific data models for the Header. Theme preference can be managed client-side (e.g., using `localStorage`).

### API Specifications
No specific API interactions for the Header.

### Component Specifications
*   **Overall Layout:** Header (Top) is persistent across all main application pages. [Source: kanoon-ui.md#2.2. Chat Interface Page]

    *   **Right:** Theme toggle (icon button, e.g., sun/moon), conceptual user avatar/name (small circle with initial/image). [Source: kanoon-ui.md#2.2. Chat Interface Page]
    *   **Styling:** Clean, minimalist, with subtle shadow or border to separate from content. Light/dark theme adaptable. [Source: kanoon-ui.md#2.2. Chat Interface Page]

### File Locations
*   Header Component: `components/common/Header.tsx`

### Testing Requirements
*   Unit tests for the theme toggle functionality.
*   Visual regression tests for responsive design and theme switching.
*   Accessibility tests for keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility.

### Technical Constraints

*   **Language:** TypeScript [Source: kanoon-architecture.md#4. Technology Stack]
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS [Source: kanoon-architecture.md#4. Technology Stack]
*   **UI Components:** Shadcn UI [Source: kanoon-architecture.md#4. Technology Stack]
*   **Animations:** Framer Motion and GSAP (for subtle transitions on theme change). [Source: kanoon-architecture.md#4. Technology Stack, kanoon-ui.md#3.6. Animations]
*   **Theming:** Support for light and dark themes. [Source: kanoon-architecture.md#2. Architectural Goals, kanoon-ui.md#3.2. Color Palette]
