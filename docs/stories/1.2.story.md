# Story: 1.2 - Chat Interface Page

## Story

As a user, I want to be able to type my legal questions into a clear input field and send them, so that I can get responses from the LLM.
As a user, I want to clearly distinguish between my messages and the LLM's responses, so that I can easily follow the conversation flow.
As a user, I want to see a subtle indicator when the LLM is generating a response, so that I know it's processing my query.
As a user, I want to be able to select from suggested legal topics, so that I can quickly initiate a conversation on a specific area of law.
As a legal professional, I want to access a dedicated interface for the 'AI Judge' mode, so that I can utilize specialized tools for case analysis.

## Acceptance Criteria

*   The Chat Interface Page (`/chat`) displays a prominent, multi-line text input area for user queries.
*   User messages are visually distinct from LLM responses (e.g., different background colors, alignment).
*   A subtle loading indicator appears when the LLM is generating a response.
*   Users can select from suggested legal topics to initiate conversations.
*   A dedicated interface for 'AI Judge' mode is accessible and visually distinct.
*   The Chat Interface Page adheres to the defined visual design guidelines (branding, color, typography, iconography, spacing, animations).
*   The Chat Interface Page incorporates accessibility considerations (semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, color contrast, etc.).

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No specific insights from previous story 1.1 that directly impact the implementation of the Chat Interface Page, other than general adherence to established architectural and UI guidelines.

### Data Models
*   **Mock Data Generation:** A client-side module will generate mock LLM responses and manage chat history. [Source: kanoon-architecture.md#5. Data Flow]
*   **Persistent Chat History:** Browser mechanisms like `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` will be used to store and retrieve mock chat data. [Source: kanoon-architecture.md#5. Data Flow]

### API Specifications
*   Next.js API routes can be utilized to simulate backend API calls for chat interactions (e.g., `pages/api/chat.ts` route to receive user query and return mock LLM response). [Source: kanoon-architecture.md#5. Data Flow]

### Component Specifications
*   **Overall Layout:** Header (Top), Sidebar (Left), Main Content Area (Right). [Source: kanoon-ui.md#2.2. Chat Interface Page]
*   **Main Content Area (Chat View - Default):**
    *   **Chat History Display:** Scrollable container. User messages (right-aligned, distinct background, rounded corners). LLM responses (left-aligned, different background, rounded corners). [Source: kanoon-ui.md#2.2. Chat Interface Page]
    *   **Loading Indicator:** Three pulsating dots or small spinning icon below last LLM message when response is pending. [Source: kanoon-ui.md#2.2. Chat Interface Page]
    *   **Typography:** Clear, readable font. Markdown rendering for LLM responses (bolding, lists, code blocks). [Source: kanoon-ui.md#2.2. Chat Interface Page]
    *   **Chat Input Area (Bottom):** Multi-line textarea (expands vertically, max height). Placeholder: "Type your legal question here...". Send button (paper airplane icon) to the right, enabled when text is present. [Source: kanoon-ui.md#2.2. Chat Interface Page]
    *   **Optional: Legal Topic Suggestions:** Row of clickable buttons or dropdown above input field (e.g., "Contract Law," "Intellectual Property," "Family Law"). [Source: kanoon-ui.md#2.2. Chat Interface Page]
*   **Main Content Area (AI Judge View - Activated):**
    *   Dedicated Interface/Workspace: Main content area transforms. Could be multi-panel layout (Left Panel: Chat-like interaction with "AI Judge"; Right Panel: "Case Details Input" (mock text fields), "Evidence Upload" (mock file input), "Legal Precedents/Statutes" (mock display area)). [Source: kanoon-ui.md#2.2. Chat Interface Page]
    *   Visual Cues: Subtle changes in accent color, icons, or background to signify "AI Judge" mode. [Source: kanoon-ui.md#2.2. Chat Interface Page]

### File Locations
*   Chat Interface Page: `app/chat/page.tsx` (Next.js convention for chat page).
*   Components for Chat Interface: `components/chat/ChatHistory.tsx`, `components/chat/ChatInput.tsx`, `components/chat/LoadingIndicator.tsx`, `components/chat/TopicSuggestions.tsx`, `components/ai-judge/AIJudgeWorkspace.tsx`, etc.

### Testing Requirements
*   Unit tests for chat input, message display, loading indicator, and topic suggestions components.
*   Integration tests for message sending and receiving (mocked responses).
*   Integration tests for switching to and from AI Judge mode.
*   Visual regression tests for responsive design and theme switching.
*   Accessibility tests for input fields, message readability, and interactive elements.

### Technical Constraints
*   **Framework:** Next.js [Source: kanoon-architecture.md#4. Technology Stack]
*   **Language:** TypeScript [Source: kanoon-architecture.md#4. Technology Stack]
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS [Source: kanoon-architecture.md#4. Technology Stack]
*   **UI Components:** Shadcn UI [Source: kanoon-architecture.md#4. Technology Stack]
*   **Animations:** Framer Motion and GSAP [Source: kanoon-architecture.md#4. Technology Stack]
*   **Theming:** Support for light and dark themes. [Source: kanoon-architecture.md#2. Architectural Goals, kanoon-ui.md#3.2. Color Palette]
*   **Responsive Design:** Adapt gracefully to different screen sizes. [Source: kanoon-ui.md#2.2. Chat Interface Page]
*   **Accessibility:** Adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratios, semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes, focus management, alternative text, form labels, responsive design for accessibility, and motion considerations. [Source: kanoon-ui.md#4. Accessibility Considerations]
