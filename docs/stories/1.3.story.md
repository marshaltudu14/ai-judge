# Story: 1.3 - Sidebar

## Story

As a user, I want to see a list of my previous chat sessions, so that I can easily revisit or continue past conversations.
As a user, I want to start a new chat session, so that I can begin a fresh legal inquiry.
As a user, I want to navigate to informational pages like 'About Us', 'How It Works', and 'FAQ', so that I can learn more about kanoon.ai.

## Acceptance Criteria

*   The Sidebar displays a scrollable list of previous chat sessions.
*   Each chat session in the list is clickable and loads its history.
*   The active chat session is clearly highlighted.
*   A prominent "New Chat" button is present to start a fresh conversation.
*   Navigation links to "About Us," "How It Works," and "FAQ" pages are included.
*   The Sidebar adheres to the defined visual design guidelines (branding, color, typography, iconography, spacing, animations).
*   The Sidebar incorporates accessibility considerations (semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, color contrast, etc.).

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No specific insights from previous stories that directly impact the implementation of the Sidebar, other than general adherence to established architectural and UI guidelines.

### Data Models
*   **Mock Chat History:** Client-side management of mock chat history, simulating persistence across sessions (e.g., using browser local storage for demonstration purposes). [Source: kanoon-architecture.md#5. Data Flow]

### API Specifications
No specific API interactions for the Sidebar, as it primarily deals with client-side navigation and mock data.

### Component Specifications
*   **Overall Layout:** Sidebar (Left) is persistent across all main application pages. [Source: kanoon-ui.md#2.2. Chat Interface Page]
*   **Sidebar:**
    *   **Top:** "New Chat" button (prominent, perhaps with a "+" icon). [Source: kanoon-ui.md#2.2. Chat Interface Page]
    *   **Middle:** Scrollable list of previous chat sessions. Each session represented by a clickable item (e.g., first few words of the conversation, date/time, or a generated summary). Active session clearly highlighted. Subtle hover effects. [Source: kanoon-ui.md#2.2. Chat Interface Page]
    *   **Bottom:** Navigation links to "About Us," "How It Works," and "FAQ" (icon + text). [Source: kanoon-ui.md#2.2. Chat Interface Page]
    *   **Styling:** Fixed width, clean background, scrollable content. Light/dark theme adaptable. [Source: kanoon-ui.md#2.2. Chat Interface Page]

### File Locations
*   Sidebar Component: `components/common/Sidebar.tsx`
*   Header Component: `components/common/Header.tsx`
*   Root Layout: `app/layout.tsx`

### Testing Requirements
*   Unit tests for the "New Chat" button and individual chat session items.
*   Integration tests for navigation links to other pages.
*   Visual regression tests for responsive design and theme switching.
*   Accessibility tests for keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility.

### Technical Constraints
*   **Framework:** Next.js [Source: kanoon-architecture.md#4. Technology Stack]
*   **Language:** TypeScript [Source: kanoon-architecture.md#4. Technology Stack]
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS [Source: kanoon-architecture.md#4. Technology Stack]
*   **UI Components:** Shadcn UI [Source: kanoon-architecture.md#4. Technology Stack]
*   **Animations:** Framer Motion and GSAP (for subtle hover effects and transitions). [Source: kanoon-architecture.md#4. Technology Stack, kanoon-ui.md#3.6. Animations]
*   **Theming:** Support for light and dark themes. [Source: kanoon-architecture.md#2. Architectural Goals, kanoon-ui.md#3.2. Color Palette]
*   **Responsive Design:** Adapt gracefully to different screen sizes. [Source: kanoon-ui.md#2.2. Chat Interface Page]
*   **Accessibility:** Adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratios, semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes, focus management, alternative text, form labels, responsive design for accessibility, and motion considerations. [Source: kanoon-ui.md#4. Accessibility Considerations]
