# Story: 1.1 - Landing Page

## Story

As a new user, I want to understand what kanoon.ai is and its main benefit, so that I can quickly decide if it's relevant to my needs.
As a new user, I want to easily find a way to start interacting with the LLM, so that I can begin my legal inquiry.

## Acceptance Criteria

*   The Landing Page (/) clearly communicates kanoon.ai's value proposition.
*   The Landing Page includes a prominent Call to Action (CTA) button that navigates to the Chat Interface Page (/chat).
*   The Landing Page is visually appealing and responsive across various screen sizes.
*   The Landing Page adheres to the defined visual design guidelines (branding, color, typography, iconography, spacing, animations).
*   The Landing Page incorporates accessibility considerations (semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, color contrast, etc.).

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous story insights for the first story.

### Data Models
No specific data models for the landing page.

### API Specifications
No specific API interactions for the landing page, as it uses mock data. Next.js API routes can be used for mock data simulation if needed for future features. [Source: kanoon-architecture.md#5. Data Flow]

### Component Specifications
*   **Hero Section:**
    *   Headline, Sub-headline/Tagline, Brief Description.
    *   Call to Action (CTA) Button: "Start Chatting Now," "Ask a Legal Question" leading to `/chat`.

*   **Feature Highlights Section (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   Visually appealing cards or sections highlighting 2-3 key benefits or features (e.g., "Instant Legal Insights," "AI Judge Mode," "Global Law Knowledge"). Each with a small icon and brief description. [Source: kanoon-ui.md#2.1. Landing Page]

### File Locations
*   Landing Page: `app/page.tsx` (Next.js convention for root page).
*   Components for Landing Page: `components/landing/HeroSection.tsx`, `components/landing/FeatureHighlights.tsx`, `components/common/Footer.tsx`, etc. (suggested structure based on modularity).

### Testing Requirements
*   Unit tests for individual components (e.g., CTA button, feature cards).
*   Integration tests to ensure navigation to `/chat` works correctly.
*   Visual regression tests for responsive design and theme switching.
*   Accessibility tests (e.g., keyboard navigation, contrast ratios).
