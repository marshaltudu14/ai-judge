## 3. Architectural Overview

The kanoon.ai frontend will be built as a Single-Page Application (SPA) using **Next.js**, leveraging its capabilities for routing, server-side rendering (SSR) or static site generation (SSG) where appropriate, and API routes for mock data simulation. The application will follow a modular component-based architecture to ensure reusability, maintainability, and scalability.

**Key Components and Structure:**

*   **Pages:**
    *   **Landing Page:** (`/`) - Entry point, showcasing product value.
    *   **Chat Interface Page:** (`/chat`) - Core interaction area.
    *   **About Us / How It Works Page:** (`/about`) - Informational content.
    *   **FAQ Page:** (`/faq`) - Common questions and answers.
*   **Layout Components:**
    *   **Root Layout:** Provides the base structure, including global styles and context providers.
    *   **Header Component:** Contains the kanoon.ai branding, theme toggle, and conceptual user avatar/name.
    *   **Sidebar Component:** Manages navigation, "New Chat" functionality, and displays the persistent chat session history.
*   **Chat-Specific Components:**
    *   **Chat Input:** Text area and send button.
    *   **Message Display:** Renders individual user and LLM messages with distinct styling.
    *   **Loading Indicator:** Visual feedback during mock response generation.
    *   **Topic Suggestions:** Optional component for pre-defined legal topics.
*   **Theming System:** Integrated using **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling and a robust theming solution (light/dark mode friendly).
*   **UI Components:** Utilizes **Shadcn UI** for pre-built, accessible, and customizable UI components, ensuring consistency and accelerating development.
*   **Animation Layer:** **Framer Motion** will be used for declarative, component-based animations, while **GSAP** will handle more complex, timeline-based animations for a polished user experience.
*   **Mock Data Layer:** A client-side module will simulate LLM responses and manage chat history, providing realistic interaction without a live backend.

This overview emphasizes a clear separation of concerns, promoting a clean and organized codebase.

## 4. Technology Stack

The kanoon.ai frontend will leverage a modern and robust technology stack to ensure a high-quality, performant, and maintainable application:

*   **Next.js (Framework):** Chosen for its powerful features like file-system based routing, API routes (for mock data simulation), and built-in optimizations, providing a solid foundation for a scalable React application.
*   **TypeScript (Language):** Provides static typing, enhancing code quality, readability, and maintainability, especially in larger codebases, by catching errors at compile time.
*   **Tailwind CSS (Styling):** A utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid UI development, promotes consistency, and simplifies responsive design, allowing for highly customizable and theme-friendly interfaces.
*   **Shadcn UI (UI Components):** Offers a collection of re-usable, accessible, and customizable UI components built with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS. This accelerates development while maintaining design consistency and adherence to best practices.
*   **Framer Motion (Animations):** A production-ready motion library for React, enabling declarative and component-based animations, perfect for creating fluid and engaging user interactions.
*   **GSAP (Animations):** (GreenSock Animation Platform) A powerful JavaScript animation library for more complex, timeline-based animations and intricate motion graphics, complementing Framer Motion for highly polished visual effects.

### **5. Data Flow**

The kanoon.ai frontend will manage its data primarily on the client-side, simulating interactions that would typically involve a backend. The data flow will be designed to be clear and predictable.

*   **Mock Data Generation:**
    *   A dedicated client-side module will be responsible for generating mock LLM responses. This module will simulate varying response times and content based on predefined scenarios or simple logic (e.g., returning a canned legal answer for specific keywords).
    *   Mock chat history will be managed client-side, simulating persistence across sessions (e.g., using browser local storage for demonstration purposes).

*   **Component Communication:**
    *   **Props:** Data will primarily flow from parent to child components via props for rendering UI elements (e.g., chat messages, user details).
    *   **Context API / State Management (Conceptual):** For global state (like theme settings or the current chat session), React's Context API or a lightweight state management solution (e.g., `useState` and `useReducer` hooks) will be used to avoid prop drilling and ensure efficient data access across the component tree.
    *   **Event Handling:** User interactions (e.g., sending a message, clicking a "New Chat" button) will trigger event handlers that update the local state, which in turn re-renders relevant components.

*   **Mock API Interactions (Next.js API Routes):**
    *   Next.js API routes can be utilized to simulate backend API calls. For instance, a `pages/api/chat.ts` route could receive a user's query and return a mock LLM response after a simulated delay. This provides a more realistic interaction model for the frontend without a true backend.

*   **Persistent Chat History (Client-Side Simulation):**
    *   To simulate persistent chat history across sessions, browser mechanisms like `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` will be used to store and retrieve mock chat data. This will allow users to see their previous conversations upon returning to the application.

### **6. Future Considerations**

While this document focuses on the frontend prototype with mock data, the architecture is designed with future expansion and integration in mind. Key considerations for future development include:

*   **Backend Integration:**
    *   Transition from Next.js API routes for mock data to actual API calls to a dedicated backend service.
    *   Implementation of robust error handling and retry mechanisms for API interactions.
    *   Consideration of authentication and authorization flows for user management.
*   **Live LLM Integration:**
    *   Integration with a real law-specialized LLM API, replacing the mock data generation.
    *   Optimization of data transfer and response parsing for efficient LLM communication.
    *   Handling of streaming responses from the LLM for a more dynamic chat experience.
*   **State Management Scalability:**
    *   As the application grows in complexity, evaluate the need for more advanced state management libraries (e.g., Redux, Zustand, Jotai) to handle global state more effectively.
*   **Performance Optimization:**
    *   Continuous monitoring and optimization of frontend performance, including bundle size, rendering performance, and network requests.
    *   Implementation of caching strategies for static assets and frequently accessed data.
*   **Testing Strategy:**
    *   Development of a comprehensive testing suite including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
*   **Deployment Strategy:**
    *   Establishment of a robust CI/CD pipeline for automated testing, building, and deployment to production environments.
